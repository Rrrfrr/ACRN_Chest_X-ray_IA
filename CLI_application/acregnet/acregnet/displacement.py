    Parameters
    ----------
    imgs : tf.Tensor
        images to be warped
        [n_batch, xlen, ylen, n_channel]
    vector_fields : tf.Tensor
        [n_batch, xlen, ylen, 2]
    vector_fields_in_pixel_space: boolean
        If vector_fields_in_pixel_space, it means that the displacements
        in the vector field are expressed in pixels.
        Therefore, they will be rescaled from image domain
        to [-1.,1.][-1.,1.] to make it compatible with the convention used
        by the warper.

    Returns
